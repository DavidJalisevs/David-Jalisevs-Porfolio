# Introduction
This is our first Group project for Software Engineering. The project is based on the game Boggle. We hope to learn more about TTD
and group co-operation. We plan to create tests to develop this game and ensure that it will work correctly and to specification.
We will be using TDD to work on this particular project.

## Who are we
We are the 2nd Year Computer Games Development Students Dawid Jerdonek, David Jalisevs, Donal Howe, Sasa Kuzmanovic.
We all study at IT Carlow.

## What is the purpose of this document
The purpose of this document is to inform ourselves about the game Boggle and research its rules.
We plan to to track our process of understanding the game in this document and write about our understanding of the rules.
We will describe the game and its rules in this document.

## Why are we doing this project
We are doing this project due to our passion to Boggle.
As a result of our Lecturer giving us this assignment we will be working on this project to create a working example of Boggle,
with a heavy emphasis on the use of TDD.
A game like Boggle is a great way to test and improve our TDD skills.

# Game description
Boggle was created by Allan Turoff and it was first distributed by the Parker Brothers.
Boggle is a word game which is played using a grid of letters.
The aim of the game is for the players to find words in sequences of adjacent letters.
Players with the most words are more likely to win but not guaranteed to do so.
The game encourages the use of unique and rare words as players have a higher chance to score points (Not made up words).
A dictionary is used with the game to verify unusual and rare words.

# Game rules
The game is started when a covered tray of 16 cubic dice with different letters is shaken.
The dice will then settle so that the players can only view the top of the dice.
A timer is set(Normally 3 minutes) then all the players will begin playing at the same time.
Each players task is to search for and construct words from sequentially adjacent cubes. 
Adjacent meaning that the letters must be touching vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
Once a word is found the player who found it must write it down on a piece of paper. Words must be at least 3 letters long.
The same letter cube may not be used twice while creating a word.
Each player uses the 3 minutes to find words. Once the 3 minutes ends, the game enters into the scoring phase.
During the scoring phase each player reads out the words which they have found.
If a word was found by two or more players the word is removed from all of the players sheets.
Players are allowed to question the validity of each word. If this happens the word is validated using a predetermined dictionary.
After the word elimination process is complete the scores are added up.
Points are awarded based on the length of each remaining word.
Plurals of words are counted as seperate words from their singular counterparts.
One cube is different to all other cubes as it has a "Qu" printed on it. This cube is used as the two letters "Q" and "U" and is scored as two letters.
The winner is the person with the highest number of points.
If a tie takes place the players longest words are checked and the player with the longest word wins.
